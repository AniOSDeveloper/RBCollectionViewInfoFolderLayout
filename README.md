#BalancedColumnLayout

A UICollectionViewLayout that uses a supplimental view to display a folder below a cell that looks like the screen was split.  Mimics the pre iOS7 springboard groups visualization.  Wrote this because all of the other "folder" controls like this use a screen shot to do the splitting, but I wanted my collection view to still be functional even with the folder open.

## Usage

1. Copy RBCollectionViewInfoFolderLayout .h/.m into your project
2. Set the layout on your collectionView to Custom, and set it's name to RBCollectionViewInfoFolderLayout
